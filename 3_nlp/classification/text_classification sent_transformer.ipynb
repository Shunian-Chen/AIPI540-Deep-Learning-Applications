    "# Text Classification using Sentence Transformers\n",
    "In this notebook we will be doing text classification using document embeddings obtained using a pre-trained [Sentence Transformer](https://www.sbert.net) model.  SentenceTransformers is a framework for sentence / text embeddings which works particularly well for shorter text.  It was developed in 2019 and uses Siamese-BERT to develop semantically meaningful sentence embeddings which can be compared using cosine similarity.  You can use a [pretrained embedding model](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) or can train your own on a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to classify the articles in the AgNews dataset into their correct category: \"World\", \"Sports\", \"Business\", or \"Sci/Tec\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**  \n",
    "- This must be run using GPU acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "**References:**\n",
    "- Read the [Sentence-BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) by Reimers & Gurevych"
