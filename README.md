# AIPI 540: Deep Learning Applications 
Welcome to the GitHub repo for AIPI 540: Deep Learning Applications at Duke University.  This repo accompanies the Deep Learning Applications course, which is part of [Duke's AI Master of Engineering program](ai.meng.duke.edu).  The Spring 2022 section is taught by [Jon Reifschneider](https://ai.meng.duke.edu/faculty/jon-reifschneider).  Please see the course Sakai site for the course syllabus.

## Repo Organization
This repository contains the following directories:  
- **0_infra_setup**: contains cheat sheet instructions and code examples for setting up deep learning VMs on the major cloud platforms
- **1_intro_neuralnets**: demo examples of how to train fully connected neural networks in PyTorch  
- **2_computer_vision**: demo examples of main computer vision tasks in PyTorch  
- **3_nlp**: demo examples of main natural language processing tasks 
- **project_descriptions**: requirements for group and individual projects

## Getting Started
Before you can run the demo notebooks or work on your projects, you will need to get your computing environment set up.  Because most of the applications we cover will require GPU access for training, you will need to set up a cloud compute environment to run them.  You may choose to work entirely in the cloud, or develop locally and sync to your cloud environment through GitHub.

In this class you may use AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and/or Google Colab Pro.  We recommend using Colab Pro for running the demo notebooks due to its low cost, however you will also need to work on one of the other three full cloud platforms to do your projects.  Which one you select is up to you - if you do not have a strong preference we recommend using Google Cloud Platform, as it provides the maximum amount of free credits and the instructor is most familiar with it.

To get started, first set up your local environment for work by creating an environment and installing the necessary packages for this course following the [setting_up_environment quickstart guide](https://github.com/AIPI540/AIPI540-Deep-Learning-Applications/blob/main/0_infra_setup/setting_up_environment.md).

Then, go to the [0_infra_setup](https://github.com/AIPI540/AIPI540-Deep-Learning-Applications/tree/main/0_infra_setup) directory and follow the quickstart guide instructions for your choice of cloud platform to set up your cloud environment.

We also extend a special thank you to Google for their support of this course through the Google Cloud Education Grant.
